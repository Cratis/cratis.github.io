// Blog authors — the single source of truth for bylines, author pages, and
// the per-post signature block.
//
// - `name`, `title`, `url`, `picture` feed starlight-blog (byline on each
//   post and the /blog/authors/<id>/ archive pages).
// - `signature` is the personal sign-off rendered below each post by
//   src/components/Footer.astro, so posts carry the author's own voice.
